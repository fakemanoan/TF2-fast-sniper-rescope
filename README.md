# Fast rezoom script for Team Fortress 2

A script that allows faster rescoping after firing. Utilises the scalu programming language.

The script works by using the in-game command "cl_autorezoom 1", which has a faster rescope time.

If left click and right click are held down at the same time for a brief period, it allows right click to be held. In this state,  cl_autorezoom is effectively set to 1 until right click is released. This allows for better, faster sniping

# Instructions for use
1) Download latest release
2) Add "exec scalu" to your autoexec.cfg
3) Add all the class cfgs to the relevant folder (/cfg/user on mastercomfig, /cfg for vanilla)
4) Done! Only active when sniper is the active class
